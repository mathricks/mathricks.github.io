            <h2>Hunt the legendary 1000BTC Puzzle on iOS</h2>
            <table>
                <tr><td align="left">
                    <p>Choose your key size and hit 'Go'. <br> Test the keys to unlock big bounties of the legendary 1000 BTC Puzzle.</p>
                    
<h2>App Description</h2>
                    
<p>Become a famous puzzle hunter and test your luck against one of the most famous cryptographic challenges on the internet. 
    Somewhere in blockchain's vast key-space lie dozens of addresses tied to a publicly known cryptographic puzzle setup more than a decade ago. Every one of the addresses is protected by nothing more than an unknown number within a known range. Bitcoin Puzzle Quest puts this legendary hunt in the palm of your hand.
</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>

<h3>1. Choose Your Challenge</h3>

<p>Pick any key size up to the 160-bit ‚Äúbeast‚Äù. The larger the space, the harder the challenge.<br/>
Not sure where to begin? Try 69-bit in Speed Dial: the lowest-bit puzzle still unsolved, with an untouched real prize, and a bit count still humanly conquerable.
</p>
<p>                  
‚Ä¢ Low-bit puzzles (already solved) offer quick feedback and are great for experimentation and learning.
    <br />
‚Ä¢ High-bit challenges bring the thrill of chasing life-changing bounties.
</p>
                    
<h3>2. Generate and Check Keys Instantly</h3>

<p> ‚Ä¢ Tap to Hunt. Generate keys one-by-one or in batches of 5, 10, 50 or 100. <br>
 Each key is converted locally to a Bitcoin address, and checked against the official puzzle address list‚Äîall offline. Keep tapping until you find the correct number (or your thumbs tap out‚Ä¶ pro tip: a DIY ‚Äúrobot finger‚Äù is totally fair game).
<br> 
    ‚Ä¢ Continuous Mode (one-time in-app purchase). Let the app press the button for you. No tapping required. Perfect for committed puzzle hunters who‚Äôd rather watch the numbers roll than their fingers ache. You can even enter a starting number for deterministic, sequential scans - ideal for targeting specific ranges or coordinating community efforts with fellow puzzle enthusiasts.
<br>
Need a breather? Double-tap the treasure-chest icon to reveal a cheeky sliding-puzzle mini-game. Because every great quest deserves a hidden side quest!
</p>
<h3>3. Global Leaderboards (Game Center)</h3>
<p>Compare how many millions of keys you‚Äôve tested, and see how you stack up against friends and puzzle hunters worldwide. Counts are reported in million-key milestones, and no key data ever leaves your device.
</p>

<h2>Who‚Äôs It For?</h2>

<p>Anyone curious about cryptographic puzzles especially about Bitcoin. Whether you‚Äôre an experienced puzzle hunter or totally new to blockchain, Bitcoin Puzzle Quest offers a playful, intuitive way into a legendary number searching puzzle.</p>

<p>Please note: Bitcoin Puzzle Quest is not a wallet, contest, or sweepstakes app. Think of it as an educational cryptography playground and a community challenge rolled into one digital puzzle hunt.

The developer is not affiliated with the puzzle creators and has no control over the funds. Apple is not a sponsor of any challenge shown.

    <strong>Third-Party Puzzle Disclaimer</strong><br>
    Bitcoin Puzzle Quest references the ‚Äú~1000 BTC Bitcoin Challenge,‚Äù a cryptographic puzzle published January 15, 2015 by an anonymous contributor to demonstrate the vastness of Bitcoin's private-key space. 
    The original challenge funded a series of 256 addresses (now 160 active ranges) with a prize pool close to 1000 BTC.<br><br>
     This app provides only a local, offline tool to generate and test private keys against that publicly-available list. The developer:
     <ul>
       <li>Is not affiliated with the puzzle's creator</li>
       <li>Does not control, sponsor, or administer any prizes or funds</li>
       <li>Does not store or broadcast keys or transactions</li>
     </ul>
     Any Bitcoin discovered belongs solely to the private-key holder. Apple Inc. is not a sponsor or organizer of this challenge.
