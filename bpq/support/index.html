    <h2>Third-Party Puzzle Disclaimer</h2><br>
    Bitcoin Puzzle Quest references the ‚Äú~1000 BTC Bitcoin Challenge,‚Äù a cryptographic puzzle published January 15, 2015 by an anonymous contributor to demonstrate the vastness of Bitcoin's private-key space. 
    The original challenge funded a series of 256 addresses (now 160 active ranges) with a prize pool close to 1000 BTC.<br><br>
     This app provides only a local, offline tool to generate and test private keys against that publicly-available list. The developer:
     <ul>
       <li>Is not affiliated with the puzzle's creator</li>
       <li>Does not control, sponsor, or administer any prizes or funds</li>
       <li>Does not store or broadcast keys or transactions</li>
     </ul>
     Any Bitcoin discovered belongs solely to the private-key holder. Apple Inc. is not a sponsor or organizer of this challenge.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td align="left">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Q: What is Bitcoin Puzzle Quest?</strong><br>
              A: Bitcoin Puzzle Quest (BPQ for short) is a puzzle-hunting app that lets you generate random (or
              sequential) keys and test them against the famous <em>Bitcoin Puzzle</em> address list ‚Äî entirely
              offline, on your own iOS device.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: How are the puzzle levels structured?</strong><br>
              A: The challenge is divided into 160 levels (originally 256), with each level using a key range that is twice as large as the previous one. For example:
              <ul style="margin-top: 0.5em;">
                <li>Level 1: <code>2‚Å∞ ‚â§ key &lt; 2¬π</code> (only 1 possible key)</li>
                <li>Level 2: <code>2¬π ‚â§ key &lt; 2¬≤</code></li>
                <li>Level 3: <code>2¬≤ ‚â§ key &lt; 2¬≥</code></li>
                <li>...</li>
                <li>Level 160: <code>2¬π‚Åµ‚Åπ ‚â§ key &lt; 2¬π‚Å∂‚Å∞</code></li>
              </ul>
              Each higher level doubles the size of the key space, making it exponentially harder to solve. To reflect this, the puzzle creator(s) placed increasing amounts of Bitcoin in higher levels as added incentive.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Q: How do I start playing Bitcoin Puzzle Quest?</strong><br>A: Open the app and start testing 
              keys by choosing your difficulty level and number of tries and hit the 'Go' button.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Q: What does ‚Äúdifficulty level‚Äù mean?</strong><br>
              A: The difficulty level defines the bit-size, i.e. the bit-length of the secret key. The 26-bit puzzle contains 2<sup>25</sup> possible
              keys (‚âà33 million); the 160-bit puzzle, the "beast", contains 2<sup>159</sup> (‚âà7.3 x 10<sup>47</sup>). Bigger bits =
              bigger needle in the haystack.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: Are there in-app purchases?</strong><br>A: Yes, there is an in-app purchase to run continuous
              scans, which also brings sequential scans.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Q: Are there ads?</strong><br>A: No, there is no ads at the moment. Enjoy the game without any
              distractions.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: Is this mining Bitcoin?</strong><br>
              A: No. Mining secures the Bitcoin network by hashing block headers; our app merely guesses private keys
              inside predefined ranges to see if any unlock the funded puzzle addresses. Think ‚Äúlottery scratch-off,‚Äù
              not ‚Äúindustrial crypto mine.‚Äù
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: How likely am I to win?</strong><br>
              A: The remaining puzzles are still astronomically hard. Low-bit ranges (e.g. 25 bits) can be
              replayed for experimenting and learning; high-bit ranges (100+ bits) are purely for the
              thrill. We highlight the lowest unsolved in the difficulty level picker ‚Äî your ‚Äúbest bad odds,‚Äù so to
              speak. To estimate your personal chance, we've added the ratio of the number of keys tried by the total number of keys in that range for each puzzle.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Q: How have some high-bit difficulty levels already been solved?</strong><br>
              A: The puzzle creator(s) left a "small" clue by making an outgoing transaction from those addresses, which reveals the public key. 
              That hint cuts the number of possible keys to try in half. Using this extra information, puzzle hunters apply specialized search techniques to recover the private keys more quickly.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Q: Why can't BPQ keep scanning in the background?</strong><br>
              A: Your device suspends nearly all CPU-intensive work when an app is backgrounded or the screen locks.
              Continuous Mode runs only while the app is in the foreground and the device is awake (e.g., charging with
              Auto-Lock disabled).
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: What is Continuous Mode and do I need it?</strong><br>
              A: Continuous Mode is a one-time in-app purchase that automates the ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù button and adds sequential scanning. Manual tapping and batch modes remain free‚Äîperfect if you prefer the DIY ‚Äúrobot finger.‚Äù<br><br>

            <li><strong>Q: How do I claim BTC if I find a winning key?</strong><br>
              A: 1) First off, copy the private key BPQ shows asap (write it down preferably). 
              2) Check out <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306983.0">the community forum</a> to learn the secure way to secure the funds. DYOR!
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: Is my data private?</strong><br>
              A: Yes. Found keys and puzzle/key-attempt counters are stored locally in UserDefaults.
              Nothing leaves your device. If join Game Center to compete against the worlwide hunters, the attempt counts will be shared
              to rank you in global leaderboards.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: Does BPQ use proprietary cryptography?</strong><br>
              A: No. Only open, standard algorithms‚Äîsecp256k1 (ECDSA), SHA-256, and RIPEMD-160‚Äîas specified
              by IETF/ISO are utilized to compute Bitcoin addresses from private keys.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: Why is my device heating up?</strong><br>
              A: Generating tons of keys per minute taxes the CPU. For marathon runs, keep your device on a charger,
              use Low Power Mode (it only affects screen refresh), and give it breaks if it gets too warm.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: Does BPQ have a mini-game?</strong><br>
              A: Absolutely! Double-tap the treasure-chest icon on the main screen to unlock a cheeky sliding-puzzle
              Easter egg‚Äîbecause every epic quest deserves a hidden side quest.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: Will there be Android / macOS / Apple Watch versions?</strong><br>
              A: Android is under exploration (no ETA). macOS on Apple silicon works via the universal build. Apple Watch support is on our roadmap as a remote dashboard.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Q: What do I do if the game crashes?</strong><br>A: Restart the game and ensure your
              device's OS is up to date. Your discovered keys are saved on your device.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Q: Can I play on multiple devices?</strong><br>A: Yes, you can play on as many devices as
              you wish. However, any found keys are saved per device.</li>
            
              <li><strong>Q: I found a bug or have a feature idea‚Äîhow do I contact you?</strong><br>
              A: Email info @ mathricks.com</a> with your app version, iOS version, device model, and reproduction steps.
              Screenshots help!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Q: How do I request a refund for Continuous Mode?</strong><br>
              A: All purchases are handled by Apple. Go to Settings ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Apple ID ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Media & Purchases ‚ñ∂Ô∏è View Account ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
              Purchase History to request a refund.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Q: Is this legal?</strong><br>
              A: Yes. Solving public Bitcoin puzzles is legal in most jurisdictions. Be sure to check local laws on digital assets and taxes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Q: Where can I learn more about this Bitcoin Puzzle?</strong><br>
