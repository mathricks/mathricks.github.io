        <h2>Game Description</h2>
        <p>Dare to journey where no one has dared before with "Astrovert"! This is an invitation to break barriers and explore the unknown reaches of space. 
            Propel through celestial gateways, from the asteroid-strewn fields of Ceres to the stormy atmosphere of Jupiter, in a quest that stretches the limits of your courage.
        </p>
        <p>Astrovert is not just another space game; it is designed with a unique narrative and gameplay mechanics that encourage users to explore space through a fresh perspective. 
            Unlike typical space games that focus on combat or racing, Astrovert is a metaphorical journey about stepping out of one's comfort zone, represented by navigating a baseball through various celestial bodies. 
            Each level introduces more speed, size increase and new obstacles that are not merely making things harder but require players to adapt their strategies, reflecting real-life growth and learning. 
        </p>
